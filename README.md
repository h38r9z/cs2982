java cProject Brief: Fleet Vehicle Selection and Comprehensive Risk Analysis 
This assignment presents a real-world management scenario where the data is incomplete or 
uncertain, requiring you to apply your engineering expertise to make an informed decision. Your task 
is to assess and recommend the most suitable vehicle type—Electric Vehicle (EV) or Petrol—for a fleet 
of 10 maintenance engineers operating from a base in Liverpool. 
The vehicles in question belong to the C-segment of European passenger cars, also known as 
"medium-sized cars" or "compact cars" in the U.S. Your decision should be based on an analysis of 
operating cost, the total cost of ownership, and environmental impact, using the data provided (based 
on VW ID3 and VW Golf Hatch) and any additional information you wish to include. 
You should submit: 
1. A report in six sections which answer the six questions below. 
2. An Excel spreadsheet containing cost model, cash-flow analysis, and the calculations or 
simulation used to answer question on quantitative risk assessment. 
Questions: 
1. Technology assessment: Undertake a brief assessment of the current state of EV car battery 
technology and how it is likely to evolve over the next 5 years focusing on: innovation, reductions 
in cost, reliability, and range. 
 
2. Cost Analysis: Use the data provided to: (i) Model the operating cost of each vehicle type over a 
4-year period, include service and maintenance, and fuel/charging costs. (ii) Estimate the total 
cost of ownership for both vehicle types over 4 years using a cash flow analysis. Include for 
example the purchase and financing costs, operating costs, and resale revenue. This analysis 
should be conducted in Excel using a discount rate of 7%. 
 
3. Model the impact of variable uncertainty on the difference in total ownership cost between the 
two vehicle types. Consider factors like annual travel distance, journey profile, fuel/charging 
prices, maintenance, and depreciation. Assess cost variability and risk over the 4-year ownership 
period. 
 
4. Qualitative risk assessment of vehicle choice: (i) Identify and evaluate non-quantifiable risks, such 
as future regulations, technology changes, supply chain disruptions, and user acceptance. (ii) Rank 
these risks by likelihood and impact on fleet operations and business performance. 
 
5. Environmental: Evaluate the CO2e footprint of each vehicle type over the 4-year operating period. 
Compare in general terms, the overall carbon footprint of Electric Vehicles (EVs) versus Petrol 
vehicles across their entire life cycle. 
 
6. Compare the costs, environmental impact, and risk profiles of the two vehicles. Recommend to 
management the most suitable vehicle type for the fleet based on your analysis, providing a clear 
justification that integrates both cost and risk considerations. 
 
7. Identify and explain key contract law principles that must be considered when negotiating 
contracts with the vehicle supplier, including warranties, liabilities, and service agreements. How 
might these impact the overall vehicle procurement and fleet operation? 3. Data section
